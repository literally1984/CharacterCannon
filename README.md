# CharacterCannon
Make any character(s) print out as many times as you want.

IMPORTANT:

This program utilizes ANSI escape codes, which are used to clear the console.

If the software you are using to run this program doesn't support ANSI escape codes, then remove System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J"); from lines 5 and 34.

Usually, Linux based shells support these codes, and Windows based shells do not.

If you want to run this on Windows (why tf would you even want to do that), then use the Window Terminal which has ANSI escape code support.
